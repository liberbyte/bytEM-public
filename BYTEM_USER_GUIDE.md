## Getting Started

### 1. What Is bytEM?

bytEM is a platform for **sharing and exchanging data**.

There are two main parts of the process:

| Process | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Supply** | Publish data that you want to make available |
| **Demand** | Request and access data |

For example:

1. A city publishes water quality data in a Supply Room.
2. A user requests the data.
3. bytEM creates or uses a Demand Room to provide access to the requested data.

bytEM also supports **Reference data**, which allows you to include the DEID of another data entity and exchange it later from a Demand Room.


### 2. Core Concepts

Before you start, it is useful to understand the following concepts.

| Concept | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Supply Room** | A room in which data is added and published |
| **Demand Room** | A room used to access requested and exchanged data |
| **DEID** | A unique Data Entity ID, usually expressed as a URL |
| **Class** | A category describing what type of data is stored in a Supply Room |
| **Reference** | A DEID pointing to another data entity that can later be found and exchanged |
| **Find** | Retrieves information about a DEID before exchange |
| **Exchange** | Brings data for a DEID into a Demand Room |

#### Supply Room

A **Supply Room** is where you add and publish data.

For example:

- Water quality data
- A dataset
- API data
- HTML content
- Reference data

Supply Rooms are shown with a 🟢 **green tag**.

#### Demand Room

A **Demand Room** is used when data is requested.

It contains the requested and exchanged data.

Demand Rooms are shown with a 🟣 **purple tag**.

#### DEID

A **DEID (Data Entity ID)** is a unique identifier for a data entity.

A DEID is usually a URL.

For example:

```text
https://waterworks.example/de/frankfurt/water-quality
```

The DEID helps identify and find the data in bytEM.

#### Class

A **Class** is a category that describes what type of data is stored in a Supply Room.

For example:

```text
water-quality
```

The Class helps categorize and identify your data.

#### Reference Data

A **Reference** contains the DEID of another data entity.

You can add Reference data to a Supply Room using:

```bash
load-supply reference
```

After the data is requested, the Reference DEID can be viewed in the **Reference** tab inside the Demand Room.

From there, you can:

1. Find the Reference DEID.
2. Review the available data.
3. Exchange the data if you have the required permissions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The user must have a **power level above 51** to perform an exchange.

#### Supply and Demand

#### Supply

Supply is created manually. You:

1. Create a Supply Room.
2. Set the DEID and Class.
3. Add your data.
4. Update the supply.

#### Demand

Demand happens when a user requests data.

bytEM creates or uses a Demand Room where the requested and exchanged data can be accessed.

> [!TIP]
> **Simple idea:** First, publish your data in a Supply Room. Then, request and access data through a Demand Room.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also create a Demand Room manually. However, in the current version of bytEM, manually created Demand Rooms do not support exchanging data.

<img width="760" alt="Exchange progress" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d212f48-cf76-44c4-b0af-595329c8bb27" />

Wait until the process is completed successfully.

#### Existing Demand Room

If a Demand Room already exists for the requested data, bytEM may use the existing room instead of creating a new one.

#### Step 5 — Open the Demand Room

After the exchange is complete, you will see a confirmation that your Demand Room is ready.

Click **Open Demand Room**.

<img width="760" alt="Demand Room ready" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/232dd90f-3fa1-433b-8fbe-7428eeb5979d" />

#### Step 6 — Log In

If you are not already logged in, you will be redirected to the login page.

Enter your:

- Matrix Username
- Password

<img width="760" alt="Login page" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adbf50b7-2424-4530-a870-423d3ed85d04" />

After successfully logging in, you will be redirected to the Demand Room.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are already logged in, you may be taken directly to the Demand Room.

If you do not have a Matrix account, click **Create one** on the login page.


### 12. Find and Exchange Reference Data

If the requested data contains the **Reference** supply type, use the Demand Room to find and exchange its **Reference DEIDs**.

#### Step 1 — Open the Demand Room

Open your 🟣 **Demand Room**.

Click **Open Data Room**.

<img width="760" alt="Open Demand Room" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4b6a722-50a6-48b6-9d3d-4dcb32f21e76" />

#### Step 2 — Open the Reference Tab

Inside the Demand Room, open the **Reference** tab.

The Reference tab displays the Reference DEIDs included in the requested data.

<img width="760" alt="Reference tab" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e81f0e1-4802-4fd3-bda0-6c50d21c1a96" />

#### Step 3 — Find the Reference DEID

Before exchanging the data, you should first perform a **Find**.

You can select the Reference DEID and use **See Overview**.

Or use the Terminal command:

```bash
find <deid_url>
```

For example:

```bash
find https://waterworks.example/de/frankfurt/water-quality
```

The **Find** action shows information about the referenced data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Perform **Find** first before exchanging the Reference DEID.

#### Step 4 — Exchange the Reference DEID

After finding the Reference DEID and reviewing the available data, you can perform the exchange.

Use:

```bash
exchange-data <deid_url>
```

For example:

```bash
exchange-data https://waterworks.example/de/frankfurt/water-quality
```

This exchanges the data for the selected DEID into the Demand Room.

<img width="760" alt="Exchange Reference data" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19cde1bb-ed2e-4149-9dbc-d61ec42d9848" />

#### Permission Requirement

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The exchange action requires the appropriate user permissions.

The user must have a **power level above 51** to perform the exchange.


### 13. View Your Exchanged Data

After the exchange is complete, open the **Exchanged** tab in your Demand Room.

<img width="760" alt="Exchanged data" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/285cf2f1-093a-4a31-8239-4e52882e1342" />

The exchanged data may be displayed in different tabs depending on the type of data returned.

| Tab | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **MetaData** | Shows information about the exchanged data |
| **Reference** | Shows reference-related data |
| **Map** | Shows geographic or location data |
| **HTML** | Shows HTML or web content |
| **API** | Shows API-related data |

### 16. FAQ

#### Do I need to write code to use bytEM?

No. Most actions can be performed using the bytEM interface.

The Terminal is also available for users who prefer using commands.

#### What is the difference between a Supply Room and a Demand Room?

A **Supply Room** is used to publish data.

A **Demand Room** is used to access requested and exchanged data.

#### What is a Reference DEID?

A Reference DEID identifies another data entity.

It is added using the **Reference** supply type and can later be found and exchanged from a Demand Room.

#### Do I need to perform Find before Exchange?

Yes.

The recommended process is:

1. Open the **Reference** tab.
2. Perform **Find** for the Reference DEID.
3. Review the available information.
4. Perform **Exchange** if you have the required permissions.

#### Can every user exchange data?

No.

The user must have the required permissions.

According to the current requirement, the user must have a **power level above 51** to perform an exchange.

#### Can I change my DEID after uploading data?

No.

Once data has been uploaded to a Supply Room, the DEID may be locked.

Make sure you set the correct DEID before uploading your data.


### 17. Troubleshooting

#### I Cannot Log In

Check:
